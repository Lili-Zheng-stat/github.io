I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [https://eceweb.rice.edu Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering] at Rice University, advised by Prof. [https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/genevera-allen Genevera Allen].\n
\n
Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the [https://stat.wisc.edu Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison], under the supervision of Prof. [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~raskutti/ Garvesh Raskutti]. I received my bachelor's degree at the [https://en.ustc.edu.cn University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)] in 2016.\n
\n
I am broadly interested in statistical and optimization problems for large-scale, high-dimensional, and dependent data. In particular, I would love to work and collaborate on the following topics: network analysis, graphical model, federated learning, tensor data analysis, stochastic algorithms, non-convex optimization.\n
